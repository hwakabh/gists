Proteins accumulate into insoluble plaque, which is a recognizable sign of the disease. The effort aims at these patches in the hope of removing or preventing them, helping to treat or prevent the progression of Alzheimer's disease. The new finding provides important insights into how and why plaques form and explains why genes, linked to cholesterol, can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. The study results also provide scientists with an important direction to prevent Alzheimer's disease.\nAlthough cholesterol is often associated with clogged arteries and heart disease, it plays an important role in helping keep the body healthy. The body produces cholesterol naturally to produce hormones and perform other important functions. The study's new findings have added a new function of cholesterol. Star-shaped cells are known to have drastic variation due to the effects of Alzheimer's disease, but it's unsure whether those cells are subject to the effects of the disease or contribute to pathogenesis. The new study sheds light on the role of stellar cells on the progression of Alzheimer's disease by creating and distributing cholesterol to neurons in the brain. This accumulation of cholesterol increases the production of amyloid beta and promotes the accumulation of plaque. Most often, cholesterol is maintained at a fairly low level in neurons, limiting the accumulation of amyloid beta. But in people with Alzheimer's disease, neurons lose their ability to regulate amyloid beta, resulting in plaque formation. The blocking of the cholesterol production process of star-shaped cells, sharply reduced the production of amyloid beta in laboratory mice. However, it is too early to know whether that would prevent the formation of plaque, but the authors believe further research will help with the fight against Alzheimer's disease.\nIn fact, the production of amyloid beta is often tightly controlled, suggesting that amyloid beta plays an important role in brain cells. Therefore, doctors should be cautious in efforts to prevent or remove amyloid beta. Additional research could shed light on how to prevent overproduction of amyloid beta to use as a strategy against Alzheimer's disease.\n
